Who We Are

South Kent School, established in 1923, is a college preparatory school for boys in grades 9 through 12 nestled in the hills of picturesque northwestern Connecticut.
We develop young men who can evolve and adapt, be globally competitive and prepared to meet the challenges posed by a changing natural environment. The time at South Kent prepares our students for success at each point in their lives. One such point, a mere four years after graduation, is the start of their careers.
Employers want leaders with broad skills who can think for themselves and solve problems in whatever form they take. Thus, a school entrusted with preparing tomorrow's global leaders must offer more than a rigorous academic program. Leadership in the evolving global economy requires the ability to recognize and adapt to change, the flexibility to adopt new technologies, insight into relationships with other people and cultures, creative problem solving within environmental constraints, and a sound mind and body. We hone these characteristics through a process that students can rely on to succeed at every stage of life.
We call this process the Hero's Journey.
Three principles define the School: simplicity of life, self-reliance, and directness of purpose.
SKS is located 45 miles west of Hartford, Connecticut, and 90 miles northeast of New York City.
