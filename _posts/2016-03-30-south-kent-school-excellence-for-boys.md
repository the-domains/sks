South Kent School "Excellence for Boys"

When you look back over the past 90 years, it is amazing to consider how much things have changed since South Kent's founding back in 1923\. Back then, a gallon of gas cost a quarter. The average home cost a family about $1,500\. But, while prices have certainly changed, clothing styles have definitely changed, and new technologies have transformed how we teach in the classrooms, the core set of principles on which the School was founded have not. When it comes to educating our boys, we still live by three fundamental principles established by South Kent's first headmaster, Samuel S. Bartlett: Simplicity of Life, Self-Reliance and Directness of Purpose.
South Kent boys come from all walks of life, but the journey they take here is the same and it is unforgettable -- it's the journey of transformation. When I speak with South Kent graduates, they all share similar stories of transformation-- of leaving one's community of origin, arriving in a new place, adapting, determining who they are and what their skill set is, learning to thrive, then determining their next step and how they can give back. It's a process of personal transformation that we at South Kent think is essential for true happiness. We help guide our boys through this process while instilling in them the values of academic, athletic, and character excellence. It's what we call the Hero's Journey.
Our graduates, many of whom have gone on to distinguished collegiate careers in academics and athletics, remember fondly their days on the "Hillside" and, together, form a cadre of enthusiastic and loyal supporters of the School. South Kent is a unique and wonderful school community. My wife, Nancy Lyon, and I have been here now for 15 years. We love the School and all that it represents. Nancy and I, and all of South Kent's talented faculty and staff, are grateful to have the opportunity to live among and work with such fine young men.
Please take the time to look over our website.
We hope you will then decide to visit our campus and experience South Kent firsthand.
