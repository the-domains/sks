  At South Kent School, athletics are part of everyday life. The school expects
  that each boy who spends time on the Hillside participates in a fitness
  oriented athletic offering at least two seasons of the year; the third season,
  he may participate in an extracurricular activity. The Physical Fitness option
  is limited to VI Form and Post-Graduate students. Each student is asked to
  contribute to a program designed to challenge him as well as build his
  selfesteem and confidence. The athletic program engages our students in
  developing teamwork by driving toward a common goal and learning that personal
  sacrifice can benefit the whole. If, for documented medical reasons, a boy
  cannot actively participate in the School’s athletic program, he is expected to
  work with the athletic trainers or serve one of the teams in another capacity.



  South Kent’s interscholastic athletic schedules are very competitive.
  Frequently, the teams compete against much larger schools. SKS has a rich
  tradition of hard work and fair play. South Kent boys compete with pride and
  remain gentlemen in victory as well as in defeat. South Kent School is a member
  of the New England Preparatory School Athletic Council and the Hudson Valley
  Athletic League. Teams have the opportunity to participate in post-season
  tournaments and compete for league and New England titles. South Kent School
  adheres to HVAL and NEPSAC guidelines for athletes, coaches, officials and
  spectators.
